react project - contextapi practice

This is react practice project using Context API (without Redux).

What I practice :
  - context api - createContext, useContext, provider, consumer
  - useState
  - Data transportation between Components by 'props'

Used Action :
  - onClick
  - onContextMenu
  - onChange

Simple Manual :
  - Background color of checked row can be changed to context.state.color.
  - context.state.color will be set by click of left mouse btn.
  - context.state.subcolor will be set by click of right mouse btn.
